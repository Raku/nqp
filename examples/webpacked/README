You need to install webpack.
And then using npm install src/vm/js/nqp-loader and src/vm/js/nqp-runtime.
For increased awesomeness we use webpack-dev-server and webpack-reload-plugin so you need to install those.


Afterwards

$ webpack

Should bundle up example.nqp into bundle.js, which is loaded by index.html.

If you run:

$ webpack-dev-server --progress --colors

A webserver will startup at localhost:8080 and example.nqp will be automatically reloaded and recompiled when you change it.
