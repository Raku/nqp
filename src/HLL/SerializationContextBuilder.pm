# A serialization context contains a bunch of objects that we want to persist
# across the compile time / run time boundary.
#
# The long term goal is that we'll support actually serializing these in an
# efficient way, and be able to do load-time linking between objects in
# different libraries. For now, that's a lot of work, so we adopt a simpler
# approach, in the hope that it will be upgradeable to a "full blown"
# mechanism in the future.
#
# A serialization context is essentially made up of objects and "events" that
# we perform on them. By performing an action on an object through the context
# builder, it ensures that the action is performed both on the object now, and
# also enough information is persisted to be able to re-create an object with
# the same state. There are two common situations.
#
# 1) We compile some code and run it straight away. In this case, the objects
#    have already been created, and we only need to do some fixing up.
# 2) We compile some code and persist it as PIR. In this case, the objects need
#    to be re-created by replaying the event stream that creates them.
#
# Essentially, we use PIR as our serialization language until we can do better.
# Note that deserialization and installation aren't the same thing; the first
# step sees us producing an array of objects, while the second is about putting
# them in places the HLL can find them.
#
# It may be that this approach will also carry almost directly over to nqpclr
# and nqpjvm.
