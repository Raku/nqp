\subsection{SPARC64 Calling Convention}

\paragraph{Overview}

The SPARC family of processors is based on the SPARC instruction set architecture, which comes in basically tree revisions,
V7, V8 and V9. The former two are 32-bit (see previous chapter) whereas the latter refers to the 64-bit SPARC architecture. SPARC is big endian.

\paragraph{\product{dyncall} support}

\product{dyncall} fully supports the SPARC 64-bit instruction set (V9), \product{dyncallback} support is missing, though.
