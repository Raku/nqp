=head1 NQP - Not Quite Perl (6)

NQP is Copyright (C) 2009-2018 by The Perl Foundation.  See F<LICENSE>
for licensing details.

This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a lightweight Perl 6-like environment for
virtual machines.  The key feature of NQP is that it's designed to be a very
small environment (as compared with, say, perl6 or Rakudo) and is focused on
being a high-level way to create compilers and libraries for virtual
machines like MoarVM [1], the JVM, and others.

Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Perl 6, NQP strives to have as small
a runtime footprint as it can, while still providing a Perl 6 object model
and regular expression engine for the virtual machine.

=head2 Building from source

=for HTML <a href="https://travis-ci.org/perl6/nqp"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/perl6/nqp.svg?branch=master"></a>

To build NQP from source, you'll just need a C<make> utility and Perl 5.8 or
newer.  To automatically obtain and build MoarVM you may also need
a git client.

To obtain NQP directly from its repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/perl6/nqp.git

If you don't have git installed, you can get a tarball or zip of NQP from
github by visiting http://github.com/perl6/nqp/tree/master and clicking
"Download".  Then unpack the tarball or zip.

NQP can run on three different backends: MoarVM, the JVM, and JavaScript.
The JVM and JavaScript backends are currently experimental.  The JVM backend
requires JDK 1.8.

Decide on which backends you want it to run, and configure and build it as
follows:

Once you have a copy of NQP, build it as follows:

    $ cd nqp
    $ perl Configure.pl --backends=moar,jvm
    $ make

If you don't have an installed MoarVM, you can have
Configure.pl build one for you by passing the C<--gen-moar> option to it as well.

The C<make> step will create a "nqp" or "nqp.exe" executable in the current
directory.  Programs can then be run from the build directory using a
command like:

    $ ./nqp hello.nqp

By default, NQP searches for the MoarVM executable and installs to the
directory C<./install>. You can change that with the C<--prefix> option to
Configure.pl.

Once built, NQP's C<make install> target will install NQP and its libraries
into the same location as the MoarVM installation
that was used to create it.  Until this step is
performed, the "nqp" executable created by C<make> above can only be
reliably run from the root of NQP's build directory.  After C<make install>
is performed the executable can be run from any directory.

If the NQP compiler is invoked without an explicit script to run, it enters
a small interactive mode that allows statements to be executed from the
command line.  Each line entered is treated as a separate compilation unit,
however (which means that subroutines are preserved after they are defined,
but variables are not).

=head2 Using NQP

B<NOTE:> there's B<no end-user support> for NQP and the behaviour can change without notice. It's a tool
for writing Perl 6 compilers, not a low-level module for Perl 6 programmers.

The L<examples directory|https://github.com/perl6/nqp/tree/master/examples> is a good place to start, with the
L<loops|https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/examples/loops.nqp> and other files. Opcodes are listed in
L<the docs directory|https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown>. NQP also has built-in routines
listed in L<the docs directory|https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/docs/built-ins.md>. You can use NQP from this
release, it will be already installed if you have built Perl6 from
scratch.

=head2 JavaScript backend

The best thing before playing with it/hacking on it is to contact pmurias via IRC at #perl6 on irc.freenode.org.
It's recommended that you use node 7.10.0 as it's the version of node.js the JavaScript backend is developed with.

Building the JavaScript backend currently requires building the moar backend:

    $ perl Configure.pl --backends=moar,js
    $ make

Currently it needs to be run like:

    $ ./nqp-js file.nqp

If you are developing nqp-js, you may want to pass the --link option to configure to have the nqp-runtime linked instead of installed

    $ cd src/vm/js/nqp-runtime; npm link .
    $ perl Configure --backends=moar,js
